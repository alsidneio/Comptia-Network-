network redundancy : ensuring network remains up and running at all times 

- multiple network cards on a server 
- multiple trunk ports on a  switch 

#### Active-Active approach 
---
- an approach where systems will be run simultaneously to share the load and provide a seamless service even if one or more systems fail #Network-plus-Definitions 
- maximizes resource utilization 
	- increases failure aversion 
#### Active Passive approach 
---
- scenario in chich systems are configured so that the standby system remains idle until the primary system fails #Network-plus-Definitions 
- not as efrficient but does provide a reliable fallback
#### Load Balancers 
---
- used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to maintain higher levels of performance and uptime
	- ensures that no one server is overloaded with requests

#### Content Delivery Networks, CDNs
---
- Network of servers that are distribured geographically to deliver content to users more efficiently and reliably  #Network-plus-Definitions 
- they store information closer to the user 
- reduces latency and easy to reroute traffic 

- HA depends on redundancy for a seamless experience
