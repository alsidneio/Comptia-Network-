## Network Components
---
**Client**: device used by enduser
**Hub**: Older tech, that connects network devices together
- Its a broadcast device 
**Wireless Access Point**: wireless hub 
**Switch**: smarter version of a hub
	- siloed conversations 

**Router**: Connects networks together
	- mainly based on IP address.  
**WAN**: wide area network

## Network Resources
---
hhow is data being moved on the network

*Client/server model*: 
- centralized management 
- better scalability 
- its costly
- ne3eds dedicated hardware
- needs dedicated OS 
- still the leading model in business network 

*Peer to Peer*:
- sharing resources betweeen clients
- issues occur when it comes to redundancy and permissions
- low cost 
- no dedicated software

## Network Geography
---
***Personal Area Network:*** 
- the smallest area, maybe a few feet 

***Local Area Network:*** 
- small office or one floor of an office building 
- connects up 100m or 300 ft. 

**Ethernet uses the IIEEE 802.3 standard**
**WiFi uses the IIEEE 802.11 standard**

***Campus Area Network***: 
- covers up to a few miles 
- usually a collection LANs

***Metropolitan Area Network***
- covers about 25 miles
***wide area networrk***
- covers  a large geograpic area

## Wired Network Topology
---
**Logical topology**: how the data flows 

**Physical topology**: where the network devices are situated geographically

#### Bus Topology
- Use a single wire that everyone would connect in to using a T-connector
  - creates a single collision domain 

#### Ring Topology
- bus topology with a circle
- ring topology has a token ring so that devices know when to talk 
- this is the only redundant typology

#### Start typoology 
- all devices are connected to  a central device 
- single point of failure on this topoology 
- used for LAN connections

#### Hub & spoke typology 
- A bigger star typology 
- used to connect WAN

#### Full mesh typology 
- works well with smaller networks 
- every node is connected to everynode 

Most business use a hybrid mesh for redundancy 

## Wireless Network Topology 
---
wireless topologies are described in Modes: 

***Infrastructure Mode***
- Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point and support wireless security protocols
- same as a star topology

***Ad-hoc***
- decentralized wireless network 
- similar to a peer to peer 

***Wireless Mesh***: 
- a interconnection of device to create a redundant wireless network. Combining a different connection types 
- wireless mesh is generally used in areas where LANs are not reliable 

## Internet of THings
 is every possible connection type (Mesh Network)
1. wifi 802.11
2. bluetooth 
3. Radio Frequency ID (RFID)
4. Near Field Communication (NFC)
	1. 4 cm distance 
5. Infrared (IR)
6. Z-Wave 
	1. short range , low latency data transfer 
	2. primarily used for home automation 
7. ANT+ , collection and transfer of sensory data
