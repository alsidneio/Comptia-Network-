- snip/cutter: cute the heavy duty cable 
- cable stripper: exposes the wire within a cable 
- crimper: attaches connector to then end of a cable 
	- supports rj 45, and rj-11 connectors 
- cable tester: used to verify the continuity of each wire in the cable
	- ensure there is no breaks within the wire 
	- multitester supports alll types of connectors
- wire mapp tool: 
	- cable tester for twisted pair 
- cable certifyer: 
	- determines category or data throughput 
	- tells us how long 
	- resistance 
	- delay of cable 
	- very expensive as compared to a cable tester 
- Voltmeter, 
	- 0 ohms means no break 
- Punchdown tool 
	- installing phone cable 
- tone generator
- detecting wire on the other end of the wire
	- fox and hound scenario
- Loop back adapter/device 
	- receive is connected to the transmit 
- time domain reflectometer 
	- locates break in a copper cable. 
		- also determines where and severity 
- Fiber light meter
	- multimode fiber uses led 
	- single mode use a laser 
- Fusion splicer 
	- permanently join two pieves of cable together
- tap: splits or copies network traffic for analysis
- Spectrum analyzer: 
	- measures frequency strength
