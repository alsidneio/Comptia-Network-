End to end network monitoring of your end user experience 

3 key metrics for monitoring network perfomance 
1. Latency
2. Bandwidth 
3. Jitter

Latency is the measure of the time it takes for data to reach its destination accross the network
- generally measured in miliseconds
- its important to measure roundtrip delay for tcp connections 
- high latency will have network performance 

Bandwith: maximum rate of data transfer accross a given network
- throughput is measured rather than bandwidth
- bandwidth is theoretical 
- you should test throughput after network changes 

jitter: when a time delay in sending packets over the network 
- Video streaming 
- Voip
- VDI , virtual desktop infrastructure 
- ensure QoS 
- categorize type of traffic
