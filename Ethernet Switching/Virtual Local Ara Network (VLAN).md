VLAN is a logical grouping of devices configured through network #Network-plus-Definitions 
-  **Trunking**: transmitting multiple VLANS over a single cable #Network-plus-Definitions 
- VLANs work by tagging each data frame with a vlan ID for routing
- reasons for using a vlan: 
	- enhanced security: segment traffic isolation
	- improved performance: decreasing broadcast domains
	- increased cost management: each vlan has seperate management controls 
	- improved cost efficiency: use existing HW to provide more ports
- **Switch Virtual Interface**: an interface on your switch that provides layer 3 routing to vlans on other ports #Network-plus-Definitions
