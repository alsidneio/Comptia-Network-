- sends text based commands to remote devices and is a very old networking protocol
- port 23
- it is not secure 

#### ssh: secure shell
---
- port 22
- telnet but encrypted 
#### VNC: Virtual Network Computing 
---
- port 5900
- designed for thin client architectures and things like virtual desktop Infrastructure
- works on all platforms 
#### RDP: Remote desktop protocol 
---
- port 3389
- allows graphical interface to another computer over a network connection

#### VDI: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure 
---
- hosts a desktop environment on a centralized server
- 
#### in-band v.. OOB
---
in-band: managing devices via telnet or secure shell
OOB: connecting to and configuring network devices via an alternate path
- management network 
- connect directly to a router 
- this form rpevents acces to management features of network devices 
- is a best practice for enterprise networks 

#### API
---
- set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications 
- they allow for automated administration managemnet and monitoring of cloud services 
- built using REST or SOAP
