Operational Technology: communication network desighned to implement an ICS
- technology that interacts with the real world

#### Industrial Control System: ICS
---
Provides the mechnaism for workflow and process automation by controlling machinery using embedded devices #Network-plus-Definitions 

- multiple ICSs create a Distributed control system, DCS

Availablility is KING in OT systems 

Fieldbus: digital serial data communication protocol used in OT networks to link different PLCs #Network-plus-Definitions 
- how a PLC communicates to the different machines

Human Machine Interface, HMI: Can be a local control panel or software that runs on a computer
- this is what is used to program the PLC

#### Supervisory Control and Data Aquisition 
---
Type of ICS used to manage large scale multi-site devices and equipment in a geographi region from a host computer

- multiple ics/dcs  systems
