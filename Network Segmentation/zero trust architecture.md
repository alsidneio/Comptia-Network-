		- its a continual identity verifiication 
	- threat scope reduction 
		- limit users access to work related tasks
	- policy driven access control 
		- involves developing manaaging and enfocing user access policies based on their roles and responsibilities  #Network-plus-Definitions 
	- secured zones

	- subject systems 
		- indivisual or entity attempting to gain access
